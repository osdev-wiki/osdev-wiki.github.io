<p><strong>x86</strong> is a backwards compatible family of little-endian, complex instruction
set architectures (ISA) introduced in 1978 by
Intel<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.
The iterations of the ISA can be broadly classified by integer width:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>16-bit x86, also referred to as x86_16 or IA-16 (introduced with the Intel
8086 in 1978)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>32-bit x86, also referred to as x86_32 or IA-32 (introduced with the Intel
386 in 1985)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>64-bit x86 (not to be confused with IA-64), also referred to as x86_64, AMD64
or x64.
It is also referred to as EM64T, IA-32e or Intel64 by Intel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_history">1. History</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first iteration of the x86 architecture was introduced in 1978 with the
8086.
The 8086 was a 16-bit CPU, with 16-bit registers, a 16-bit data bus and a
20-bit address bus.
Thus it was able to address one megabyte of RAM.
Slightly later, the 8088 CPU was introduced, which was internally identical to
the 8086, but had a 8-bit data bus.
The 8088 was used by the original IBM PC, introduced in 1981, which was the
predecessor of all modern PCs.
Thus, the x86 architecture became the dominant architecture on personal
computers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1982, Intel introduced the 186, 188 and 286.
The 186 and 188 where similar to the 8086 and 8088 respectively, but where
intended for embedded systems, and included peripheral that were not compatible
with IBM PCs.
The Intel 286, however, was intended for multi-user, multitasking environments.
Thus the 286 introduced features for multitasking and memory protection and was
able to address up to 16 megabytes of RAM.
To preserve compatibility with the 8086, most of the features introduced with
the 286 could only be used in a mode called <strong>protected mode</strong>.
The 286 and most subsequent x86 processors start in <strong>real mode</strong>, which emulates
the behavior of a 8086.
The 286 started to gain wide adoption with the introduction of the IBM AT in
1984.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1985, Intel introduced the 386.
This new interation introduced support for 32-bit integers and extended
protected mode to introduce, among other things, paging and support for up to
four gigabytes of RAM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1989, the Intel 486 was introduced, with new features, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An integrated "x87" FPU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>L1 cache used for increased IPC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System management capabilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To this day, every properly-implemented x86 processor has backwards
compatibility, all the way back to the original Intel 8086.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_operating_modes">2. Operating modes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>x86 has a handful of operating modes, used for backwards compatibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_real_mode">2.1. Real mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Real mode is the operating mode that an x86 processor boots into. It mostly
models the original 16-bit 8086 processor, with a few extensions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While data can be handled 16 bits at a time, segment offset registers offer
addressing up to 21 bits, which provides the processor with 1MiB of addressable
memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Real mode contains no access rings or protection of any kind.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_protected_mode_16_bit">2.2. Protected mode (16-bit)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>16-bit protected mode runs with 16-bit data and instructions, but segment
offset registers are replaced with segment selector registers, which point to
an entry into the 16-bit GDT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programs written for real mode may have a handful of compatibility issues with
16-bit protected mode, but instructions are still read in the same format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>16-bit protected mode is rarely used.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_protected_mode_32_bit">2.3. Protected mode (32-bit)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>32-bit protected mode reads and addresses with 32-bit values. This is the mode
commonly referred to as "protected mode".
Protected mode mandates a 32-bit before entry.
Protected mode is officially entered when a far jump is performed that sets CS
to an offset which points to a code segment in a 32-bit GDT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>32 bits of addressing provide up to 4GiB of addressable virtual memory.
However, with PAE paging extensions, the virtual address space can be mapped to
64-bit physical addresses, theoretically allowing up to 16PiB of physical
memory to be addressed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_compatibility_mode_x86_64_only">2.4. Compatibility mode (x86-64 only)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compatibility mode runs during the transition from protected mode to long mode.
Compatibility mode runs similarly to protected mode, and is used to allow
64-bit structures to be loaded before entering proper long mode.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_long_mode_x86_64_only">2.5. Long mode (x86-64 only)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Long mode handles data up to 64 bits in general purpose registers, with
extensions that allow for the handling of up to 512 bits of data at a time.
Addressing in long mode is 64-bit, theoretically allowing for up to 16PiB of
virtual memory to be <em>directly</em> addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, on most x86-64 processors, only 48 bits of addressing are actually
implemented, with the notable exception of processors that support 5-level
paging.
These 48-bit addresses must all have the top unsupported bits be set or unset,
resulting in two "halves" of the virtual address space. These addresses are
referred to as "canonical" addresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name "long mode" refers to the commonplace technical term for a 64-bit
integer, a "long".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the unfulfillable amount of virtual memory, PAE paging is mandated in
long mode.
This allows for contiguous mapping of physical RAM, with memory-mapped IO out
of physical RAM space.
This also allows x86-64 operating systems to implement "swap memory", a process
where virtual addresses point to data not in physical RAM, but rather stored on
disk.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_extensions">3. Extensions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>x86 processors have a plethora of extensions that expand on standard behavior.
The most notable, x86-64, implements 64-bit addressing and long mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section only contains a handful of extensions, there are too many to list
at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_x86_64">3.1. x86-64</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The x86-64 extension is quite expansive, implementing the 64-bit operating mode
and 64-bit addressing.
It is nearly impossible to find a working computer today that does not support
x86-64.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_paenx">3.2. PAE/NX</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PAE/NX implements 4-level paging, and adds a handful of properties to pages to
implement extensive memory protection, including NX, a flag to disable
execution on a particular page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most operational computers today support PAE/NX.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_x87">3.3. x87</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>x87 is a floating-point calculation extension.
While technically an extension, it is supported on most x86 processors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sse">3.4. SSE</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SSE is a 128-bit data extension.
It adds 8-16 128-bit general purpose <code>XMM</code> registers, and instructions to
perform SIMD vector math.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SSE has several versions. x86-64 processors are mandated to support at least
SSE2.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_avx">3.5. AVX</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AVX is a 256-bit data extension. It performs a purpose similar to SSE, and
implements a handful of 256-bit <code>YMM</code> registers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AVX was released alongside the Haswell microarchitecture in 2014.
A not-insignificant number of operational computers today do not support AVX.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_avx_512">3.5.1. AVX-512</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AVX-512 is not a single extension, but rather a family of extensions.
It is similar to AVX, but implements a handful of 512-bit <code>ZMM</code> registers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AVX-512 is quite new, with consumer processors supporting AVX-512 being
released in 2018.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>
It is yet to become widely supported.</p>
